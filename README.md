Practice SQL subqueries with real-world-style tasks and sample data.
# 📊 SQL Subquery Mini Project

This mini project is designed for practicing and mastering SQL subqueries — from basic concepts like `IN` and `NOT IN` to more advanced patterns using aggregation and correlated subqueries.

---

## 🧠 What You'll Practice

- `IN`, `NOT IN` subqueries
- Aggregation with `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MAX`
- Filtering using `HAVING` with subqueries
- Correlated subqueries
- Comparison using `=`, `>`, `<`, `ANY`, `ALL` (coming soon)
